      "This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for medical image classification. A ResNet-34 model was trained on a dataset of colorectal cancer images (MUS, NORM, STR), and along with a pre-trained ShuffleNet V2 encoder, they were applied to prostate cancer and animal face datasets. The performance of these encoders was analyzed and compared using t-SNE visualizations.",
